## üß† What Is a HWID Ban?

A **HWID ban**, short for **Hardware ID ban**, is when a game‚Äôs anti-cheat system blocks access based on the unique identifiers of your computer‚Äôs hardware. Even after changing your IP address or using a new account, you‚Äôll still be blocked if your system‚Äôs HWID matches one flagged by the anti-cheat.

### What Gets Tracked in a HWID Ban?
Most HWID bans involve tracking one or more of the following components:
- CPU ID
- GPU serial number
- Motherboard serial
- HDD/SSD identifiers
- MAC address
- BIOS UUID
- RAM and monitor info

If you‚Äôve ever wondered **what is HWID**, it‚Äôs essentially a fingerprint for your PC. If your HWID is flagged, your entire system is effectively banned from the game.

‚Ä¶the anti-cheat will still detect your banned **HWID** and block you again.
